Hi! Iam a Scientist with over 10 years of experience working in Medicinal Chemistry (in silico drug discovery). Professor in Medicinal Chemistry (UNLP). Passionate about teamworking, and applying design thinking and development of cheminformatics and bioinformatics methodologies applied to drug discovery.

Extended Bio
======
Dr. Carolina Bellera is a Pharmacist from UNLP. She is an Adjunct Researcher at CONICET since 2019 and Adjunct Professor of the Chair of Medicinal Chemistry and New Strategies Applied to Drug Discovery at the Faculty of Exact Sciences, UNLP, since 2018. She has published more than 40 scientific articles in refereed international journals in the field of cheminformatics, computer-assisted drug discovery/repositioning. She obtained the award for the best doctoral thesis in Bioorganic Chemistry from the Argentine Chemical Association (2014), the UNLP Innovation Award (2015) and the Tony B Award for Young Scholars from The Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening (SLAS) (2019). She has been an external evaluator of projects and scholarships for agencies and universities, including CONICET, National Agency for Scientific and Technical Promotion of Argentina (R&D+i Agency), Ministry of Education of Argentina and National University of La Plata.
